          <p class="project-name">Find stocks in story </p>
          <p class="project-description">
            Currently, you're looking to buy something from a shop, but when you went there, you found out that the item you're looking for is out of stock. Now you're planning to go to another shop. However, before you visit, you're wondering if this website has information about whether the item is available in that store. This way, you can save time and energy by not going directly to the shop if they don't have the item. On this website, the store owners provide such details. Because of this, you can understand how much stock they have, how many items are available, and even predict how well a particular session is selling. This helps you decide whether to visit that shop or not.
            And also in this website, the details are provided by the store owner themselves. Due to this, they can understand how much stock they currently have and how many items are available. They also use this information to keep track of sales and predict how well a particular session is performing. This website serves as a tool for these purposes.

          <p class="project-description">
            The main use of an e-commerce website is to buy and sell products or services online. It allows people to shop conveniently from their computers or mobile devices, browse a wide range of items, compare prices, make secure payments, and have products delivered to their doorstep. E-commerce sites make shopping easier and more accessible, connecting buyers and sellers in a virtual marketplace.</p>

          <p class="project-name">Simple chatbot</p>
          <p class="project-description">
            I create a simple chatbot, but it will be quite basic. In it, I'll just focus on a little bit of training, nothing too complex. This is just a small project I'm working on.</p>
